# Pet Shelter Registry System - Architecture Document

## System Overview

The Pet Shelter Registry System is a web-based application designed to streamline pet shelter operations, including pet intake, status management, adoption workflows, and medical record keeping. The system serves multiple user types: shelter staff, volunteers, adopters, and veterinary partners.

## Architecture Goals

- **Scalability**: Cloud-hostable with ability to handle growing pet and user data
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for staff and volunteers working on mobile devices
- **Security**: GDPR-aware with secure handling of personal and pet data
- **Maintainability**: Simple, testable architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Fast loading times for critical operations (pet lookup, status updates)

## Core Data Models

### Pet
```typescript
interface Pet {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'dog' | 'cat' | 'other';
  breed: string;
  age?: number;
  dateOfBirth?: Date;
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'unknown';
  status: 'in_shelter' | 'foster' | 'adopted' | 'medical_hold';
  description?: string;
  photoUrl: string;
  intakeDate: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### AdoptionApplication
```typescript
interface AdoptionApplication {
  id: string;
  petId: string;
  adopter: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    address: string;
  };
  reason: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  submittedAt: Date;
  reviewedAt?: Date;
  reviewedBy?: string; // staff user ID
  notes?: string;
}
```

### MedicalRecord
```typescript
interface MedicalRecord {
  id: string;
  petId: string;
  date: Date;
  type: 'vaccination' | 'checkup' | 'treatment' | 'surgery' | 'other';
  description: string;
  veterinarian?: string;
  nextDueDate?: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: string; // staff user ID
}
```

### User (Staff/Admin)
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'staff' | 'volunteer';
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

## JSON File Storage Architecture

### Data Storage Strategy
The system uses a simple but robust JSON file-based storage approach suitable for small to medium-sized shelters:

#### File Structure
```
data/
├── pets.json           # All pet records
├── users.json          # Staff user accounts
├── applications.json   # Adoption applications
├── medical-records.json # Medical history records
└── backups/           # Automated backup files
    ├── pets-YYYY-MM-DD.json
    ├── users-YYYY-MM-DD.json
    └── ...
```

#### Data Integrity Features
- **Atomic Writes**: Use temporary files and rename operations to prevent corruption
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas validate all data before writing
- **Backup Strategy**: Automatic daily backups with configurable retention
- **Concurrent Access**: File locking to prevent race conditions
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from backup if main files are corrupted

#### JSON Database Layer
Custom database abstraction providing:
- CRUD operations with TypeScript interfaces
- Query capabilities (filter, sort, paginate)
- Relationship management between entities
- Data migration utilities for schema changes
- Performance optimization with in-memory caching

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Migration Path**: Easy migration to PostgreSQL when growth demands it
- **Performance**: In-memory indexing for fast queries
- **Backup & Restore**: Simple file-based backup and restore procedures
- **Data Export**: Built-in CSV export for reporting and migration

   - Geographic backup requirements?

### Security & Legal Context
8. **Data protection requirements**
   - Specific GDPR/privacy law compliance needs?
