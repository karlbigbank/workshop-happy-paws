# Workshop Conversation Summary

## 1. Initial Workshop & Presentation Outlines
- Designed **presentation and workshop structures** around the theme *“Embrace AI in Your Role”*.  
- Deliverables:  
  - **20–25 min Presentation Outline** → storytelling, role-based use cases (SE, QE, BA), AI development curves, risks & guardrails, and call-to-action.  
  - **60–90 min Workshop Outline** → interactive, role-based exercises (coding, testing, analysis).

## 2. Workshop Scenario – Pet Registry
- Real-world scenario: *“Animal shelter needs a Pet Registry to make business more efficient.”*  
- Roles divided:  
  - **Business Analysts (BAs):** Extract user stories, acceptance criteria, visuals, stakeholder presentation.  
  - **Software Engineers (SEs):** Turn BA stories into architecture, plan, tech stack, code.  
  - **Quality Engineers (QEs):** Build test plan, implement automated tests, commit frequently.  
- Summary story:  
  - Shelter staff struggle with spreadsheets and paper.  
  - Stakeholders: director, worker, volunteer coordinator, adopter, vet, IT advisor.  
  - Lifecycle simulation: BA → SE → QE → feedback loop.

## 3. BA Inputs – Stakeholder Interviews
Created **long, raw interview transcripts** with natural “noise”:  
1. **Anna (Director):** Wants dashboards, reporting automation, simple + mobile-friendly system.  
2. **Marko (Worker):** Needs faster intake, status updates, photo integration, auto adoption contracts.  
3. **Leena (Volunteer Coordinator):** Struggles with scheduling, unclear pet statuses, wants mobile-friendly task assignment and reminders.  
4. **Sofia (Adopter):** Wants real-time availability, detailed pet profiles, online applications, mobile filters, adoption/medical history access.  
5. **Dr. Karl (Vet Partner):** Needs centralized medical history, vaccination alerts, easier updates.  
6. **Tarmo (IT Consultant):** Recommends MVP scope, cloud/mobile-first, simple + affordable, GDPR compliance.

## 4. Workshop Role Packages
Created **cover pages and role instructions**:

### Business Analysts
- **Inputs:** interview transcripts.  
- **Tasks:** extract stories, acceptance criteria, wireframes, stakeholder deck.  
- **Deliverables:** backlog, visuals, presentation.  

### Software Engineers
- **Inputs:** BA backlog.  
- **Tasks:** architecture, phased plan, implement MVP, incremental commits.  
- **Deliverables:** plan, architecture, codebase, commits, README.  

### Quality Engineers
- **Inputs:** SE codebase.  
- **Tasks:** test plan, acceptance criteria mapping, agent flows, automated tests.  
- **Deliverables:** test plan, automated tests, results, feedback to SE + BA.

## 5. Parallel Workshop Setup
- Roles will work **in parallel**, not sequentially.  
- Therefore:  
  - SEs need a **predefined BA handoff package** (MVP backlog).  
  - QEs will later need a **predefined SE handoff package** (codebase + summary).  

- Created **MVP backlog for SEs**:  
  - **Pet intake & profile management**  
  - **Status updates**  
  - **Adoption workflow**  
  - **Basic medical records**

## Current Status
- **Presentation + workshop structure** → done.  
- **BA materials** → 6 interview transcripts + cover/instructions.  
- **SE materials** → BA handoff package (MVP backlog).  
- **QE materials** → cover/instructions ready, QE input package (code + SE handoff) still pending.
