# üêæ Facilitator‚Äôs Guide ‚Äì Pet Registry Workshop

## Workshop Overview
**Scenario:** Happy Paws Animal Shelter needs a **Pet Registry System** to replace spreadsheets and paper processes.  
**Format:** Parallel role-based workshop (Business Analysts, Software Engineers, Quality Engineers).  
**Duration:** 90‚Äì120 minutes (can be adjusted).  
**Goal:** Participants experience a full software project cycle: requirements ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing.  

---

## Roles & Tracks
- **Business Analysts (BAs):**
  - Input: Stakeholder interview transcripts.  
  - Tasks: Extract user stories, acceptance criteria, visuals, stakeholder deck.  
  - Output: Backlog + wireframes + stakeholder presentation.  

- **Software Engineers (SEs):**
  - Input: BA handoff package (pre-prepared MVP backlog).  
  - Tasks: Plan architecture, break down tickets, implement MVP code in phases.  
  - Output: Implementation plan + working codebase + commits + README.  

- **Quality Engineers (QEs):**
  - Input: SE handoff package (pre-prepared starter code).  
  - Tasks: Test plan, acceptance criteria mapping, E2E agent flow, automated tests.  
  - Output: Test plan + automated tests + results + feedback.

## Timing & Agenda

### ‚è± 0‚Äì10 min ‚Äì Introduction
- Welcome participants.  
- Explain the **scenario (Happy Paws Shelter)** and goals.  
- Assign participants to their **roles**.  
- Provide each role with their **input package**.  

---

### ‚è± 10‚Äì45 min ‚Äì Parallel Work (Phase 1)
- **BA Track:**  
  - Analyze interview transcripts.  
  - Extract user stories + acceptance criteria.  
  - Start sketches/wireframes.  
- **SE Track:**  
  - Review MVP backlog (from BA handoff).  
  - Draft architecture + tech stack choice.  
  - Define phased plan + tickets.  
- **QE Track:**  
  - Review codebase + README.  
  - Draft test plan, map to acceptance criteria.  
  - Identify E2E agent flow.  

*Facilitator role:* circulate, prompt teams with guiding questions.  

---

### ‚è± 45‚Äì75 min ‚Äì Parallel Work (Phase 2)
- **BA Track:**  
  - Finalize backlog and acceptance criteria.  
  - Create quick wireframes of key screens.  
  - Prepare stakeholder presentation slides.  
- **SE Track:**  
  - Begin coding MVP features.  
  - Commit work incrementally, with messages tied to tickets.  
- **QE Track:**  
  - Implement first automated tests.  
  - Validate at least one end-to-end adoption flow.  
  - Document initial results.  

*Facilitator role:* encourage teams to share ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù between groups.  

---

### ‚è± 75‚Äì90 min ‚Äì Sharing & Feedback
- **Each role presents briefly (5 min each):**  
  - BAs: backlog + wireframes + summary deck.  
  - SEs: plan + architecture + code progress.  
  - QEs: test plan + sample automated tests + findings.  
- Facilitate short discussion on **what worked well / what was difficult**.  

---

### ‚è± 90‚Äì120 min ‚Äì Optional Extended Time
- Cross-team collaboration round:  
  - BAs refine acceptance criteria based on SE/QE feedback.  
  - SEs adjust implementation plan or fix gaps.  
  - QEs expand coverage or suggest new acceptance criteria.  

---

## Checkpoints for Facilitator
- **Early Check (10 min):** Ensure each role understands their task and deliverables.  
- **Midpoint (45 min):** Check progress‚Äîare BAs producing stories, SEs planning commits, QEs drafting test cases?  
- **Sharing (75‚Äì90 min):** Encourage concise presentations, focus on learnings not perfection.  

---

## Materials to Prepare in Advance
- **BA Track:** Stakeholder interview transcripts (already written).  
- **SE Track:** MVP backlog handoff package (already written).  
- **QE Track:** Starter codebase + README (to be prepared separately).  
- **Tools:** Whiteboard/Figma for wireframes, GitHub/GitLab for commits, test framework setup.  

---

## Facilitator Tips
- Remind participants: **speed > perfection** ‚Üí focus on practicing the workflow, not building production-ready software.  
- Encourage **storytelling**: teams should explain *why* they made decisions, not just *what* they built.  
- Keep energy high with checkpoints and mini ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments.  
- Highlight the **handoff friction** between roles‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the learning.  

---

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of the workshop, participants should:  
1. Experience the full cycle from stakeholder interviews ‚Üí backlog ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing.  
2. Understand the importance of **clear handoffs** between roles.  
3. Produce tangible artifacts: backlog, wireframes, code commits, test plans, automated tests.  
4. Reflect on how **AI copilots** could assist in each phase (optional debrief).
