# Interview Transcript – Shelter Worker (Marko)

**BA:** Thanks for taking the time, Marko. Can you walk me through what a typical day looks like for you at the shelter?

**Marko:** Yeah, no problem. So… mornings are usually crazy. I get in around 8, and the first thing I do is check the kennels and cages, see who’s still here, who’s going to the vet that day, who needs feeding. Then, if we’ve had any new arrivals overnight—sometimes the police or rescue groups drop them off late—I have to do intake. That’s… honestly, the part that eats up the most time.

**BA:** Intake, meaning registering a new pet?

**Marko:** Exactly. Right now, it’s all paper and spreadsheets. I fill out this intake form with name, breed, color, weight, vaccination status—if we even know it—and then later I have to copy that into a spreadsheet. Sometimes I forget to do the copy immediately, and then someone else enters it later, but they use different formatting, and… well, we end up with three versions of the same animal in the system. *laughs* It’s messy.

**BA:** That sounds frustrating. What would make intake easier?

**Marko:** Honestly? A simple screen where I can type in the pet details once, maybe snap a photo, and that’s it. If I could also tick boxes for medical needs or “needs training,” that would save me tons of time. And if it automatically updated adoption lists, even better. Right now, we add pets to a whiteboard in the hallway so volunteers know who’s here. That’s old school, but it’s what works since the spreadsheets are never up to date.

**BA:** How about the adoption process—what’s that like for you?

**Marko:** Also paperwork-heavy. When someone adopts, I have to print this contract, fill it in by hand, then scan it and save it on our shared drive. Sometimes I forget the scanning part, and then Anna comes looking for it. If the system could generate adoption forms automatically with the pet’s details, and maybe store them digitally, that would be huge. Even just having a button that says “mark as adopted” would simplify things.

**BA:** Do you interact with volunteers much in your role?

**Marko:** All the time. Volunteers feed pets, walk dogs, clean cages. The problem is, they often don’t know which pets are “off limits.” For example, if a cat is reserved or on medical hold, but that info is only in my notebook, a volunteer might accidentally let someone handle them. I’d like a system that shows pet status clearly—available, reserved, adopted, medical. Something simple, color-coded maybe.

**BA:** Do you ever need to coordinate with the vet?

**Marko:** Yes, and it’s messy right now. We keep vaccination cards in a shoebox. Literally, a shoebox. If the vet calls and asks, “Which dogs need boosters this month?” I have to dig through the box. If we could attach vaccination records to the pet’s profile, I’d be thrilled. Then I wouldn’t be the guy with the shoebox. *laughs*

**BA:** Understood. What devices do you normally use?

**Marko:** I mostly use a tablet—we have a couple in the shelter. Sometimes I check things on my phone if I’m out with the dogs. Honestly, if it doesn’t work on mobile, I won’t use it. I don’t want to go back to the office every time I need to update something. And I don’t want to deal with passwords that take ten tries to enter while I’m holding a leash in one hand.

**BA:** Good point. Any specific frustrations with the current spreadsheets?

**Marko:** Oh yeah. Formatting is inconsistent. Some people type “yes” for vaccinated, others type “Y,” and some leave it blank. Searching for info is terrible—you have to scroll forever. And photos—we don’t have them in the sheets. We keep them in a folder, but the file names are random, like “dog1.jpg.” Half the time, I don’t know which dog is which. Photos connected to pet profiles would make a big difference.

**BA:** If you could wave a magic wand, what would your dream system look like?

**Marko:** Hmm… okay. I log in on my tablet, I click “Add Pet,” I enter the basics, snap a photo, tick a few checkboxes. Done. The pet shows up on the adoption list automatically, with photo and status. If someone adopts, I click “Adopted,” it fills in the contract, stores it in the system, and the pet disappears from the public list. And I can easily filter: “Show me all dogs ready for adoption,” “Show me cats needing vaccination.” That would save me hours every week.

**BA:** That’s a clear vision. Anything else?

**Marko:** Just… keep it simple. I don’t have time to fight with technology. If it makes my life harder, I’ll go back to my paper notebook. But if it saves me time, I’ll use it every day.
