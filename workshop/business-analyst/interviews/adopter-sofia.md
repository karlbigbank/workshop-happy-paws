# Interview Transcript – Adopter (Sofia)

**BA:** Thanks for speaking with me, Sofia. Can you tell me about your experience adopting from Happy Paws Shelter?

**Sofia:** Sure. I adopted a cat from here last year. The staff were really kind, but the process itself was… a bit confusing. I found the pet on their website, but when I called, they told me the cat had already been adopted. That was disappointing.

**BA:** So the information wasn’t up to date?

**Sofia:** Exactly. I actually drove an hour to see that cat. Then I had to start over, looking through photos and asking which pets were still available. It felt like wasted time, and honestly, I almost gave up. Luckily, I ended up adopting another cat, but the process should have been clearer.

**BA:** What would have helped in that situation?

**Sofia:** Real-time updates. If a pet is adopted, it should disappear from the list immediately. Or at least be marked as “reserved” so people know. Also, photos are really important. The current website has some, but sometimes the quality isn’t great, or there’s no info beyond “dog, male, 2 years.” I’d like to know more about the pet’s personality—friendly, shy, good with kids, things like that.

**BA:** So richer pet profiles would make a difference?

**Sofia:** Definitely. I want to see age, breed, temperament, health status, maybe even a short story about the pet. Like, “Bella loves long walks and is good with children.” That makes it easier to imagine if the pet will fit into my life. Right now, it feels like shopping for a pet without enough details.

**BA:** How was the actual adoption process once you picked a pet?

**Sofia:** A lot of paperwork. I had to fill out forms by hand, then wait for staff to approve them. It took almost an hour, and some of it was repetitive—writing my address three times. I don’t mind paperwork, but it could have been faster. If I could have filled it out online beforehand, that would have saved a lot of time.

**BA:** What about communication with the shelter staff?

**Sofia:** They were friendly, but sometimes information got lost. For example, I asked about vaccination records, and it took a while for someone to find the right folder. I think they do their best, but without a proper system, it’s messy. If I could log into a portal and see “Your pet has received X vaccinations, next due on Y date,” that would be fantastic.

**BA:** Would you use an online portal like that?

**Sofia:** Yes, for sure. Even after adoption, I’d like to check things like vaccination reminders or adoption history. It would make me feel more secure, like everything is official and documented.

**BA:** Do you usually search for pets on your phone or computer?

**Sofia:** Mostly on my phone. I browse during breaks or while commuting. If the site isn’t mobile-friendly, it’s frustrating. I need to be able to filter easily—like show me only small dogs, or only cats under 2 years old. Right now, the search is very basic.

**BA:** What’s the most frustrating part of the whole process for you?

**Sofia:** Honestly, the uncertainty. Not knowing if a pet is really available. That’s why I called before visiting, but even then, it wasn’t accurate. It makes me lose trust. If the shelter had a reliable, up-to-date system, I’d feel much more confident.

**BA:** And what was the best part of the process?

**Sofia:** Meeting the animals and talking to the staff—they really care. I just wish the technology supported them better. It would make the whole experience smoother for both adopters and the shelter.

**BA:** If you could summarize your wish list, what would it be?

**Sofia:** Okay:  
1. Real-time availability updates.  
2. Detailed pet profiles with photos and temperament info.  
3. Online applications I can fill out in advance.  
4. Easy mobile browsing with filters.  
5. Access to medical/adoption history after I adopt.  

**BA:** That’s very clear. Thank you, Sofia.
