# Interview Transcript – Shelter Director (Anna)

**BA:** Thanks for meeting with me, Anna. Can you tell me about your biggest challenges running Happy Paws Shelter?

**Anna:** Sure… where do I start? *laughs* We’ve grown a lot in the past two years, which is great, but it also means everything feels kind of chaotic. Right now, most of our records are just in spreadsheets, and sometimes in paper binders. For example, we have one spreadsheet for pets in the shelter, another one for pets in foster homes, and then another file where we track adoptions. And… not everyone updates them consistently. So sometimes I’ll look at the adoption sheet and think a pet is still here, but in reality, it’s been adopted two weeks ago. We look unprofessional when adopters call about a pet that’s already gone.

**BA:** So keeping the data accurate and up to date is a problem?

**Anna:** Exactly. I need one central place, a kind of “source of truth,” where I can see at a glance: How many animals are here today? How many are in foster care? Which ones have adoption applications pending? Right now, I have to email or call staff just to get that answer, which is a waste of everyone’s time.

**BA:** What about your own responsibilities—how does this impact you directly?

**Anna:** Well, for me the biggest headache is reporting. Every month, I need to prepare numbers for our board and for donors. They want to see things like: how many adoptions we had, what’s the average stay length for pets, how many medical treatments we paid for. Right now, it’s a nightmare. I usually spend an entire afternoon copying and pasting numbers from different sheets and then double-checking because sometimes the totals don’t match. It makes me nervous—I don’t want to share wrong data.

**BA:** Sounds stressful. Would you say automated reports are a must-have?

**Anna:** Oh yes, absolutely. Even something simple, like a dashboard that shows adoption counts, number of pets by category, maybe even trends over time. If I could click a button and export that for the board, that would be a lifesaver. I know donors would also appreciate seeing accurate data. Transparency is huge for us—we need to show we’re trustworthy.

**BA:** Okay, that’s clear. What about daily operations? Do you also interact with the data yourself?

**Anna:** Sometimes, yes. I don’t handle the intake of animals day-to-day, but I do review applications, and I like to check how full we are. For example, if I know we have a big intake of kittens coming from another shelter, I want to see immediately how many kennels are free. Right now, I have to ask Marko, our shelter worker, to count them for me. It’s not efficient.

**BA:** Would you expect the new system to handle things like space management?

**Anna:** Ideally, yes. Even a simple feature where pets are assigned to a “status”—in shelter, in foster, adopted, pending, medical hold—that would already give us a much clearer overview. We don’t need fancy capacity planning yet, but statuses are important.

**BA:** Got it. You mentioned earlier that the organization is nonprofit. How does that affect your expectations for a solution?

**Anna:** Budget is always tight. We cannot afford a huge IT system with license fees that eat half our donation income. We’d need something lightweight, maybe modular so we can expand over time. Like, we could start with just a registry of pets and adoption workflow, and later add volunteer scheduling or donor management. It should be future-proof but not overwhelming in the beginning.

**BA:** What about devices? How do your staff and volunteers work—desktops, laptops, tablets?

**Anna:** A mix. In the office, we have two old desktops. But most of the time, our staff walk around with tablets when checking in new animals or updating feeding logs. Volunteers often use their phones to communicate. So, whatever we build must be mobile-friendly. I can’t stress that enough. If people can’t use it on their phones or tablets, they just won’t update it, and then we’re back to square one.

**BA:** That’s a strong point. Any integrations or external systems you’d want it to connect with?

**Anna:** Hmm… well, in the long run, yes. I’d love if the pet profiles could connect directly to our public website, so adopters always see the latest animals. Right now, we upload pictures manually, and half the time, pets get adopted before the site is even updated. But for phase one, I’d say just internal use is enough. If we can get the basics right, that’s already a win.

**BA:** Understood. Are there any risks or “don’ts” we should be aware of?

**Anna:** Yes—please don’t give me a system that requires an IT person to manage full-time. We don’t have that capacity. If it breaks, we need to be able to handle it ourselves, or at least get simple support. Also, security is important—we deal with adopter data, contracts, sometimes even medical information. So I’d want some kind of protection, but nothing that makes login so complicated people avoid it.

**BA:** Makes sense. Before we wrap up—what’s your vision for this system? If it worked perfectly, what would success look like for you?

**Anna:** Success would be… I open the system in the morning, and I immediately see: “30 pets currently in shelter, 12 in foster, 8 pending adoption.” I can click on any pet and see their full history—when they arrived, what medical checks they’ve had, adoption status, everything in one place. At the end of the month, I hit “report,” and I can confidently share the numbers with my board without wasting hours. And my staff actually *use* the system because it makes their lives easier, not harder.

**BA:** That’s a strong vision. Thank you, Anna. This will be very helpful for shaping requirements.
