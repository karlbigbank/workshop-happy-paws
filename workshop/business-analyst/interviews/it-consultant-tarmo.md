# Interview Transcript – IT Consultant (Tarmo)

**BA:** Thanks for joining me, Tarmo. Can you tell me about your role with Happy Paws Shelter?

**Tarmo:** Sure. I’m not on staff, but I’ve helped them on and off with IT advice—setting up email, choosing cloud storage, that kind of thing. I’m more of a general consultant. They reached out to me because they know they need a proper system, but they don’t know where to start.

**BA:** From your perspective, what are their biggest challenges?

**Tarmo:** Well, the main issue is fragmentation. Data is scattered across spreadsheets, paper forms, random folders. They’re doing heroic work, but the tools are basic. I’ve seen three different people track the same information in three different ways. That’s not sustainable as they grow. They need one system of record.

**BA:** What kind of system do you think would work for them?

**Tarmo:** Something lightweight, cloud-based, and mobile-friendly. The staff don’t sit at desks all day—they’re walking around with animals. So if it doesn’t work on tablets and phones, forget it. I’ve seen nonprofits waste money on big enterprise systems they never use because they’re too complicated. For Happy Paws, start small, nail the basics, then expand.

**BA:** When you say basics, what do you mean?

**Tarmo:** Core registry features: adding pets, tracking status (in shelter, foster, adopted, medical hold), adoption workflow, and maybe vaccination tracking. That’s it for phase one. Once they get comfortable, you could add volunteer scheduling, donor management, or website integration. But don’t build Rome in a day. If the MVP solves 70% of their problems, it’s already a win.

**BA:** Do you see them managing the system themselves, or would they need outside help?

**Tarmo:** They don’t have an IT team, so the system has to be self-service. If updates or maintenance require an admin with special training, it won’t last. Ideally, it should be SaaS, or at least something with a simple interface. Think “fill in a form, click save,” not “run SQL queries.”

**BA:** What about security—do you think that’s a concern?

**Tarmo:** Definitely. They handle adopter information, contracts, and medical notes. That’s personal data. GDPR applies here. So, access controls, secure logins, and data protection are a must. But again, keep it simple—no one wants to type a 12-character password with symbols while holding a dog leash. Maybe support Google login or something easy but safe.

**BA:** Any thoughts on cost?

**Tarmo:** They’re a nonprofit. Cost is always a constraint. I’d recommend using existing platforms if possible—like a no-code solution, or an open-source registry tool they can customize. Building something from scratch is possible, but they need to be realistic about budget. If developers volunteer time, great, but long-term, they’ll need something sustainable.

**BA:** What about integrations?

**Tarmo:** Future phases, yes. Linking the system to their website is obvious—they want pet profiles online, updated automatically. Maybe later, connect to a donation platform. But that’s phase two or three. Right now, I’d tell them: let’s fix intake, adoption, and medical tracking first.

**BA:** What’s the biggest risk you see if they don’t get this right?

**Tarmo:** Two things: burnout and credibility. Staff and volunteers spend too much time fighting spreadsheets. That leads to mistakes, wasted effort, and frustration. And from the outside, adopters and donors lose trust when information is wrong. If someone donates money but sees sloppy processes, they question how the shelter is run. That could cost them support.

**BA:** If you had to summarize your top three recommendations, what would they be?

**Tarmo:**  
1. Start small: focus on pet registry + adoption workflow.  
2. Make it cloud-based and mobile-friendly.  
3. Keep it simple and affordable—something they can actually maintain.  

**BA:** That’s very clear. Thank you, Tarmo.
