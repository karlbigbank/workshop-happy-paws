# Interview Transcript – Volunteer Coordinator (Leena)

**BA:** Thanks for your time, Leena. Can you tell me about your role at Happy Paws Shelter?

**Leena:** Sure. I coordinate all of our volunteers—right now we have around 25 active people, plus a few who come in occasionally. My job is to assign them tasks, track their hours, and make sure they know what’s going on in the shelter. It’s rewarding work, but… honestly, it’s a lot of juggling.

**BA:** What kind of juggling?

**Leena:** Well, communication is the hardest part. Volunteers are wonderful, but they’re not always consistent. Some use WhatsApp, some prefer email, some call me directly. I keep a Google Sheet with their availability, but it’s never 100% accurate because people change their schedules last-minute. So sometimes we end up with three people showing up to walk the same dog, while another dog doesn’t get walked at all. It’s frustrating.

**BA:** That does sound tricky. How do you keep track of tasks right now?

**Leena:** Mostly spreadsheets and sticky notes. For example, if a dog needs daily walks, I’ll try to assign it to a volunteer and note it down. But if that volunteer cancels, I have to scramble. I don’t have one place where I can see: “Which volunteer is assigned to which pet, and what tasks are covered today?” It’s scattered across emails, chats, and my own notes.

**BA:** So visibility is a problem?

**Leena:** Yes, big time. Also, volunteers don’t always know which pets are available for interaction. For example, some animals are on medical hold or already reserved for adoption. If I don’t tell them directly, they might accidentally take the wrong pet out. We’ve had awkward situations where a family came to see a dog, but a volunteer had already taken it out for a walk because they didn’t know it was reserved. That makes us look unorganized.

**BA:** What would help you avoid those issues?

**Leena:** Ideally, a system where I can log in, see all pets with their statuses, and assign volunteers to them. Like: “This dog needs three walks today, who’s covering them?” Or “This cat needs daily medicine—assign it to someone who’s trained.” If volunteers could also see that info directly, even better. Right now, everything goes through me, which creates bottlenecks.

**BA:** Do volunteers themselves ask for any tools or features?

**Leena:** They often ask for clarity. They want to know: Which pets need attention? Which ones are off limits? And they’d like reminders. For example, if someone signs up to walk dogs on Thursday, maybe the system could send them a reminder. Right now, I send reminders manually, and sometimes I forget.

**BA:** How about tracking volunteer hours—do you handle that too?

**Leena:** Yes, and it’s another headache. Some volunteers need proof of hours for school or community service. I keep a spreadsheet, but it’s hard to keep up. People forget to log their hours, then come back weeks later asking for a certificate. If the system could automatically log hours when they check in or mark tasks as done, it would save me a lot of time.

**BA:** What about devices? How do volunteers usually access information?

**Leena:** Most of them use their phones. They’re students, parents, retirees—everyone has a phone. A few use tablets at the shelter, but not many. So mobile access is critical. If it’s desktop-only, they won’t bother updating anything.

**BA:** Let’s talk about challenges. What’s the most stressful part of your role?

**Leena:** When communication fails. Like, imagine I planned everything for the day, but two volunteers don’t show up. Suddenly, pets aren’t fed or walked, and I’m scrambling. Or when a volunteer gives the wrong info to an adopter because they didn’t know the pet’s status. Those moments are embarrassing. I want a system that reduces the chance of human error.

**BA:** Do you see yourself using the system every day?

**Leena:** Absolutely. If it helps me assign tasks, track hours, and keep pet statuses clear, I’d live in it. Right now, I’m stuck between spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and my own notes. It’s too much.

**BA:** If you could describe your dream system in a sentence, what would it be?

**Leena:** *laughs* Okay… a mobile-friendly app where I can see all pets, their statuses, and volunteer assignments in one place—and where volunteers can log in themselves, see what to do, and mark it done. That would make my life so much easier.

**BA:** That’s great. Anything else?

**Leena:** Just keep it simple. Volunteers aren’t tech experts. If it takes more than a minute to figure out, they won’t use it. It needs to be clear, visual, maybe color-coded. Green for available, red for reserved, yellow for medical. Easy.
