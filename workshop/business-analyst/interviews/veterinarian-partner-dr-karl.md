# Interview Transcript – Veterinarian Partner (Dr. Karl)

**BA:** Thanks for making time, Dr. Karl. Can you tell me about your role in working with Happy Paws Shelter?

**Dr. Karl:** Of course. I’m their main veterinary partner. I run a small clinic nearby, and I handle check-ups, vaccinations, and sometimes more serious treatments for their animals. We’ve been working together for about five years now. It’s rewarding, but also… sometimes frustrating, because of how information is managed.

**BA:** What do you mean by frustrating?

**Dr. Karl:** Well, I don’t always know which animals need care or when. They usually call me with a list, or someone shows up with a dog and a pile of papers. Vaccination records are handwritten, sometimes hard to read, and occasionally missing altogether. For example, I’ll ask, “Has this cat had its rabies shot?” and the staff have to go dig through a folder. Sometimes they don’t find anything, so I redo the vaccination just to be safe. That’s not ideal—for the animal, or for me.

**BA:** So clearer medical records would help?

**Dr. Karl:** Absolutely. If I had a system where I could log in and see each pet’s medical history—vaccinations, deworming, treatments, allergies—that would save everyone time. Even just being able to see “last vaccine: June 2024, next due: June 2025” would be huge. Right now, I often rely on verbal updates, and details get lost.

**BA:** How often do you interact with the shelter?

**Dr. Karl:** Weekly, at least. Sometimes more. We do routine vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and emergency cases. I might see five or six shelter animals in a week. That’s manageable, but the paperwork adds unnecessary friction. I’d rather spend time treating animals than chasing missing records.

**BA:** Do you ever provide documentation back to the shelter?

**Dr. Karl:** Yes, I give them medical certificates and vaccination cards. But again, it’s paper. They scan or file it somewhere, and sometimes it doesn’t get entered properly. Then, a month later, someone calls me asking, “Did you vaccinate Rocky the dog?” I can look it up in my own system, but it shouldn’t fall back on me every time. If they had a central registry, I could upload or at least confirm the data directly.

**BA:** Would you personally use a digital system if it existed?

**Dr. Karl:** Yes, but it has to be simple. I don’t have time to learn complicated software. If I could open a secure page, search for a pet by ID or name, and update the vaccination record, that would be enough. Bonus points if I could add notes, like “this dog has a heart murmur, avoid certain medications.”

**BA:** What about alerts or reminders?

**Dr. Karl:** That would be excellent. If the system flagged which pets are due for vaccines this month, I could plan ahead. Right now, it’s reactive—I wait for the shelter to call me. With alerts, I could even batch treatments and save them money.

**BA:** Speaking of money—does cost influence your expectations?

**Dr. Karl:** Yes, they’re a nonprofit, so I know budgets are limited. I wouldn’t expect a full-fledged medical system like we use in the clinic. But even a simple registry with health info would cover most of our needs. As long as it’s accurate and up to date, it doesn’t need to be fancy.

**BA:** From your perspective, what’s the biggest risk if the current system doesn’t improve?

**Dr. Karl:** The risk is that animals miss treatments or get double treatments. Missed vaccines can lead to outbreaks. Over-vaccination wastes money and stresses the animal. Also, adopters sometimes ask me about medical history, and if I don’t have the full record, it undermines trust. The shelter does great work, but poor documentation makes them look less professional than they really are.

**BA:** That makes sense. If you had to list your top three wishes for a system, what would they be?

**Dr. Karl:**  
1. Centralized, accurate medical history per pet.  
2. Ability for me (or staff) to update vaccination/treatment records.  
3. Alerts for upcoming vaccinations or treatments.  

**BA:** Got it. Thank you, Dr. Karl. This was really valuable.
